# Dynamic Frustum Filtering (DFF)

Dynamic Frustum Filtering (DFF) is a general and plug-and-play frustum-based enhancement framework for RGB-D indoor 3D object detection.  
DFF leverages **2D detector priors to dynamically adjust point cloud resolution, suppress background noise, and enhance spatial representation in cluttered indoor scenes.

This repository currently includes partial datasets and non-essential components.  
The full implementation will be released after the paper is accepted.


🔒 Full code and training pipeline will be released after the paper is accepted.
